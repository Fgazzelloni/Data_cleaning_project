# Data_cleaning_project

## Coursera project Getting cleaning data JHU

In this project data collected are assembled and manipulated to be used

Data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  


The project includes a R script called run_analysis.R which contains:

- merges of the training and the test sets to create one data set
- extraction of the descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) for each measurement
- description of the activities in the data set
- data labels with descriptive variable names
- from this data set is made a second, independent tidy data set of each variable average 


This repository includes:

- a tidy data set as described above
- a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis 
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md 
- this README.md explaining how all of the scripts work are connected.
